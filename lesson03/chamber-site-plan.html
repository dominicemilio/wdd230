      <h2>Scenarios</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>1) Lena Schmidt - A Backpacker from Germany</h3>
        <p><strong>Persona:</strong> Lena is a 24-year-old German woman who is backpacking through Colombia. She loves
          adventure, although she has to be budget-minded in everything she does. She absolutely loves nature. She is
          fluent in English and speaks Spanish at an intermediate level.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Lena walks into the Chamber of Commerce, wearing a heavy backpack. She walks
          toward the reception desk with a friendly smile and asks in Spanish, "Buenos dias. I'm Lena from Germany, and
          I'm travelling all throughout South America, but specifically here in Colombia. I've heard wonderful things
          about Guatape, and I'd like to know if there are any good hiking trails, and places to camp. Do you have any
          recommendations?"</p>
        <p><strong>Her Chamber of Commerce Needs:</strong> Hiking trail maps, with difficulty levels and approximate
          walking time. It is also necessary to have information on permitted camping areas, along with information on
          local guides. It would be good to provide tour information.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>2) George and Martha Miller - Retirees from Florida</h3>
        <p><strong>Persona:</strong> George and Martha are married retirees in their late 60s from Florida. They love
          travelling and exploring new cultures and cuisine. They also appreciate hand-crafted items and look for unique
          ones wherever they visit. They really like to travel comfortably and enjoy guided tours.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Martha says "Hello, we're George and Martha Miller from Florida. We are visiting
          Guatape and are impressed by the colorful houses. We are interested in local handicrafts and like to know
          where we can find them. We would also like to know where we can order authentic Colombian cuisine, like the
          'Bandeja Paisa'. Could you recommend these to us?"</p>
        <p><strong>Their Chamber of Commerce Needs:</strong> Information on local artisans and their workshops.
          Recommendations for restaurants that serve traditional Colombian food. Information on guided tours, with area
          maps.</p>
      </article>

        <h3>3) Mateo Vargas – Small Business Owner in Guatape</h3>
        <p><strong>Persona:</strong> Mateo is a 35-year-old resident of Guatape who owns a small restaurant that
          specializes in traditional Paisa cuisine. He works hard and is passionate about his restaurant, but he doesn’t
          attract enough tourists to keep his business open.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Mateo enters the Chamber of Commerce with a rather worried look on his face. He
          says hello to the chamber representative and explains his situation. He tells her that he owns a small
          restaurant just off the main square. He then explains the type of cuisine that they prepare with authentic
          food from recipes that have been passed down through generations. He then continues by telling the chamber
          representative how difficult things have been for lack of tourists. She explains to him that there may be some
          local advertising that he could participate in.</p>
        <p><strong>His Chamber of Commerce Needs:</strong> Local tourism information and marketing opportunities. He
          could also use some connections at hotels and tour operators who could help promote his business. He could
          also be included in the local tourism brochure.</p>
